# Profile Card Design – Frontend Fundamentals

## Project Overview

This project is a Profile Card UI built using HTML and CSS.  
The goal was to design a clean, modern, and responsive profile card while applying core frontend concepts.

The card displays:

*   Profile picture  
      
    
*   Name and designation  
      
    
*   Short bio  
      
    
*   Social media reference buttons  
      
    

The design focuses on clarity, alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

## Objectives of the Assignment

The main objectives were:

*   To understand basic HTML structure  
      
    
*   To apply CSS styling and layout  
      
    
*   To learn Flexbox for alignment  
      
    
*   To maintain consistent spacing and typography  
      
    
*   To create a visually appealing yet professional UI  
      
    

* * *

## What We Implemented

### 1\. Profile Card Layout

A single card component was created to hold all profile details.  
The content is center aligned for better visual balance.

### 2\. Profile Image

*   A local image (profile.png) is used.  
      
    
*   This avoids random or real-person images.  
      
    
*   Ensures consistency across reloads.  
      
    

### 3\. Typography Hierarchy

*   Name uses a larger, bold font.  
      
    
*   Designation uses a smaller, muted color.  
      
    
*   Bio text uses normal weight with good line spacing.  
      
    

This helps users easily scan the information.

### 4\. Social Media Buttons

*   GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Portfolio links are added.  
      
    
*   Each button uses an icon.  
      
    
*   Clicking the icon redirects to the respective page.  
      
    

* * *

## Additional Enhancements (Beyond Basic Requirements)

To improve visual quality and score better marks, the following were added:

### Subtle White Glow

*   A soft white glow around the card.  
      
    
*   Helps the card stand out on a dark background.  
      
    

### Dark-Mode Glass Effect

*   Slight transparency with blur.  
      
    
*   Gives a modern glassmorphism feel.  
      
    
*   Maintains readability.  
      
    

### Smooth Hover Animations

*   Card slightly lifts on hover.  
      
    
*   Icons gently move and glow.  
      
    
*   Animations are subtle and professional.  
      
    

* * *

## Technologies Used

### HTML5

Used for:

*   Structuring the profile card  
      
    
*   Defining content elements like image, text, and links  
      
    

### CSS3

Used for:

*   Styling the card and background  
      
    
*   Flexbox for centering  
      
    
*   Spacing, padding, and margins  
      
    
*   Hover animations and transitions  
      
    
*   Glass and glow effects  
      
    

No JavaScript was used.

* * *

## How Flexbox Is Used

Flexbox is used to:

*   Center the card vertically and horizontally  
      
    
*   Align social media icons in a row  
      
    
*   Maintain spacing between elements  
      
    

This makes the layout responsive and clean.

* * *

## How the Program Executes

1.  The browser loads index.html.  
      
    
2.  HTML defines the structure of the profile card.  
      
    
3.  style.css applies styling and layout.  
      
    
4.  Flexbox centers the card on the screen.  
      
    
5.  Hover effects activate on user interaction.  
      
    
6.  Clicking an icon redirects to the linked website.
